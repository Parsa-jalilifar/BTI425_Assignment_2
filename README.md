# IT-Terminology-Angular-App

The purpose or objective of the assignment is to create a substantial Angular app that interacts with a web API.

The app’s purpose is to define or translate the English-language terminology we use in the computer programming courses in the School of SDDS, for use by all students, whether or not English is a student’s first language.

We have so many students who are learning English and computer programming at the same time, and that is a challenging combination. The technical terminology is often unclear, complicated, and sometimes isn’t explained well. For example, when we say “asynchronous”, what does it clearly mean in English, as well as in a student’s first language?

The general functionality of the user app will likely include:

- View and browse a list of all terms
- Search for a term, in any language
- View details about a term, and its meaning in English and in other languages
- Add a new term, English, or in another language (including its first or initial definition)
- For an existing term (English or other), add another definition/data

In summary, the app would have some of the utility of a dictionary, Wikipedia, and other resources
